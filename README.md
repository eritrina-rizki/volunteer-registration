This project is about creating a form, with HTML and CSS, in volunteer registration page for the client, Save the Bay, that enable visitors to register their interest in volunteering with the organization. For practice my coding skill, I added form validation with JavaScript and store the submitted data to Session Storage in browser, also added an edit button to allow visitors editing their registration data after submitting the form.
<br><br>
This is the preview of the volunteer registration page:

<br><br><br>
After submitting the form, visitors will be directed to the success state page:

<br><br><br>
In the third page, visitors can read their registration invoice, edit their data, and save it to the browser's Session Storage, so the data will not be lost when they return to the volunteer registration page:

I realize that there are still many mistakes and lacks in this project. I really welcome your feedback, so that I can improve my skills and make a better performance in the next project.
<br><br>
Thank you!
